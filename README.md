# About the project:

Born from combining ideas and suggestions from our PVP members, we needed both a membership portal to monitor membership status and personal points for attending events (attendance verified at the event) along with an interactive bulletin board for clubs to post events on. These ideas were combined and centralised into the TESC-portal project managed by the Tech team [@TESC](https://github.com/UCSDTESC).

## The vision

In creating this portal, we wish to:

- Stream-line interaction and marketing of club events
- Promote membership participation in events
- Provide a central hub for all of our internally developed tools in the future

- **Basic requirements**

  - [x] User log in and management
  - [ ] Different views for TESC internal members, club principal members and general club members

- **Membership requirements**

  - [ ] Profile picture and description management for clubs
- **Bulletin Board Requirements**
